Description: Using this function we can find the proportion of x=1. This function is particularly helpful with binary data, if one variable (e.g. TRUE).
This function is called prop_true() because of its ideal use of using this with binary data, where TRUE can be set to 1 and FALSE can be set to 0.
This can be used in the case of variables in a list e.g. prop_true(x = c(1, 0)).
